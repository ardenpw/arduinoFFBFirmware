**Based on the insurmountable amount of work done by [YukMingLaw](https://github.com/YukMingLaw) on [ArduinoJoystickWithFFBLibrary](https://github.com/YukMingLaw/ArduinoJoystickWithFFBLibrary).** Again, I can't say thanks enough for the work that he has done to give me a base to work off of and improve.

This project aims to add support for more accurate and cheaper magnetic encoders such as the as5600 to reduce mechanical wear, along with FOC (field-oriented control) motor control for stronger and more precise force feedback for the user.
